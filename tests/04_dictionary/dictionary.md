Write an async function named getMeanings. getMeanings should take an argument and make a call to the free Dictionary API passing in the word passed to the function. 
See an example of how to use the api and the shape of the response here
https://dictionaryapi.dev/

write an async function named getFirstDefinition. It should take one argment the word and then return the first definition of that word listed. The actual definition I am looking for is a string and does get a little nested so be on the lookout for that. 

The call you are making will not change but the work to filter out the data between the functions will change.
